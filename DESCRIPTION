Description: Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular and powerful tool for 
  estimating causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, 
  classical methods rely on strong assumptions such as the exclusion criterion,
  which states that instrumental effects must be entirely mediated by 
  treatments. In the so-called "leaky" IV setting, candidate instruments are 
  allowed to have some direct influence on outcomes, rendering the average 
  treatment effect (ATE) unidentifiable. But with limits on the amount of 
  information leakage, we may still recover sharp bounds on the ATE, providing 
  partial identification. This package implements methods for ATE bounding in 
  the leaky IV setting with linear structural equations. For details, see Watson
  et al. (2024) <arXiv:2404.04446>.

Description: Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular and powerful tool for 
  estimating causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, 
  classical methods rely on strong, untestable assumptions such as the exclusion
  criterion, which states that instrumental effects must be entirely mediated by 
  treatments. In the so-called "leaky" IV setting, candidate instruments are
  allowed to have some direct influence on outcomes, rendering the average 
  treatment effect (ATE) unidentifiable. But with limits on the amount of 
  information leakage, we may still recover a partial identification 
  interval for the ATE. This package implements methods for ATE bounding in the 
  leaky IV setting with linear structural equations.
